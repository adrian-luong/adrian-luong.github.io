My personal portfolio website, and some day a blog.

I understand that it's not beautiful like others sites. AI, such as _Lovable_, is capable of making a better one.
Go ahead and laugh, perhaps you deserves a good one every once in a while. After all, life is shit to all of us.
You don't like it, then it makes 2 of us. I don't like its sole developer, either.

I have no excuse on how bad this site is. It is made from barrel scratch with a minimal amount of efforts, skills and willpower.
I'm not even sure what I'm doing most of the time in my life. Most of my other code projects are too pointless to continue, in short: anhedonia.
This website is the only thing that I can keep to consistently develop until this day.

I don't know which will perist first, me or the site. Well, who cares, we're stuck here on Earth until the very end.
Expect the site to have something 3D since I'm obsessed with WebGL technology, and AI is incapable of doing that kind of website at the moment.
